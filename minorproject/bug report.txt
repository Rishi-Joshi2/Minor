1) Cart page:
        when the quantity goes less than 1 by pressing minus button, that medicine will dissapear, but when we reload the
        page with f5, the medicine next to it will show quantity as 0.
        -> Database working fine.
        -> Ajax working fine.
        -> Error may be in html.

        *Solved :D

2) ${url}product_details/${product_name.pk}
        -> mycart.js
        -> in url, after success was changed to "/".

3) Index page image's tag = "Navkar Medical"
        -> change this to "Navkaar Medical"

4) Index page has static data not dynamic
